%We present ROBOSHERLOCK, an open source
software framework for implementing perception systems for
robots performing human-scale everyday manipulation tasks.
In ROBOSHERLOCK, perception and interpretation of realistic
scenes is formulated as an unstructured information manage-
ent (UIM) problem. The application of the UIM principle
supports the implementation of perception systems that can
answer task-relevant queries about objects in a scene, boost
object recognition performance by combining the strengths
of multiple perception algorithms, support knowledge-enabled
reasoning about objects and enable automatic and knowledge-
driven generation of processing pipelines.
ROBOSHERLOCK uses annotations in form of logical
atoms in order to be able to ask structured queries and
perform logical reasoning about annotations added by the
AEs. The main reasoning engine used in ROBOSHERLOCK is
based on SWI-Prolog, a general purpose logic programming
language providing bindings for the most common proce-
nural languages like C++, Java. AEs can be equipped with
Prolog programs, which consist of facts and rules. Relevant
annotations are automatically asserted as facts into the Prolog
knowledge base.
