In this part, we present an application for a human-aware robot guide, where we used parts of the system shown in the previous chapters, adapted for this scenario. This study was done as part of the european project SPENCER\footnote{http://www.spencer.eu/}.

 SPENCER  was born with the idea to study social awareness issues in human-robot interaction, and particularly in the application of a robot guide. This project aimed at joining complex robotic algorithms  with social signal processing, by modeling people not as objects, but as entities with relationships, social rules, and culturally diverse backgrounds. The final goal of the project was deploying a robot guide, in collaboration with the KLM airline\footnote{https://www.klm.com}, in the Schiphol airport of Amsterdam, performing user studies on real passengers to evaluate the validity of the system.

Chapter~\ref{chapter:spencer} will explain how we built a human-aware robot guide, starting from our system, while chapter~\ref{chapter:spencer_results} will present our experiments in a laboratory setting and in the airport.
