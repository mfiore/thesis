The european project SPENCER \footnote{http://www.spencer.eu/} was born with the idea to study social awareness issues in human-robot interaction, and particularly in the application of a robot guide. This project aimed at joining complex robotic algorithms  with social signal processing, by modeling people not as objects, but as entities with relationships, social rules, and culturally diverse backgrounds. The final goal of the project was deploying a robot guide, in collaboration with the KLM airline\footnote{https://www.klm.com}, in the Schiphol airport of Amsterdam, performing user studies on real passengers to evaluate the validity of the system.
