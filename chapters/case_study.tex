\section{Human-Aware Robot Guide}
\subsection{Introduction}
\subsubsection{Overview on the topic}
One interesting problem in human-robot interaction is developing robots able to guide humans, by offering a tour of attractions in an area or simply by helping humans to reach a destination.
A generic mobile robot platform should possess a vast set of skills, which includes advanced perception, motion planning, and task planning. These skills are not enough for a robot guide, which is deployed in highly dynamic human environments, and need to be complemented with human-aware behaviors.

%Examples
Different robot guides have been studied and developed, starting with pioneers like Rhino and Minerva \cite{thrun2000probabilistic}.  Few systems have actually been deployed for long period of time in human environments. Rackhman \cite{clodic2006rackham}, a museum guide with human-aware behaviors, is an example of such system, and has been deployed in a science museum for several months. Another example of robot guide was developed in \cite{bueno2011autonomous}, where the robot is integrated  in a smart museum environment, using virtual avatars with human-aware interfaces, associated to exhibitions, in order to convey information to the users. After these first experiments, several researchers have tried to focus on the social aspects of the problem, which are especially important if the robot needs to offer information. Studies like \cite{yousuf2012development,evers2014development} focus on how the robot should address humans, concentrating on spatial relationships and on how the robot can convey information.

Building and using mental models of users is particularly important in these scenarios, particularly if we are developing a proactive robot, which need to be able to approach people in order to offer its services, and to monitor their level of interest in the interaction. \cite{Jensen2005} presents an assessment of human-robot interaction during an exhibition, where perceptual and task related data are used to compute an internal state according to the scenario. With these information, the robot can compute a new emotional state and interact accordingly with users.
In \cite{rashed2015toward}, a robot guide is able to infer people intention by studying their trajectories. The authors conducted experiments in a museum, managing to classify user trajectories in three classes and developing a method to identify participants that may need guidance. 

Recently there has been emphasis on robot navigation algorithms that explicitly reason about human beings in the environment differently from other static or dynamic obstacles. Starting from \textit{Proxemics}, researchers have investigated explicit social signals based on human-posture and affordance of the environment to improve legibility of robot motion. For detailed discussion on human-aware navigation algorithms we refer the readers to \cite{kruse2013human,rios-ijsr-2014}. Human-aware navigation in a museum situation was studied in \cite{samejima2015building}, where the authors build environmental maps, which include information learnt from human trajectories and postures, in order to plan safe paths that do not disturb humans present in the area. 

The robot guide scenario can become more complex if we consider not only single humans, but groups. Humans, in fact, tend to naturally form groups, which can be classified in different types, based on their size, on their level of cohesion, on their duration, and other factors \cite{forsyth2009group}.  Studying group formations is a complex problem, since the robot must be able to detect humans, which can be occluded in populated environments, and to model their social interactions, which can be ambiguous. One of the most powerful and expressive social cues is distance, used in different works to track social relationship, like \cite{luber2013multi}. 

\subsubsection{Motivations}
We believe that most robot guide systems are focusing on the social aspects of the problem, and on human-aware navigation, without fully considering the fundamental aspects of joint actions. Guiding is a collaborative task, where the robot does not need only to reach a destination, but also to ensure that its followers reach it, while providing a socially acceptable experience to them. In order to achieve this goal, the robot needs to constantly monitor its users, to adapt to their behaviors and to be ready to proactively help them.

The european project SPENCER \footnote{http://www.spencer.eu/} was born with the idea to study social awareness issues in human-robot interaction, and particularly in the application of a robot guide. This project aimed at joining complex robotic algorithms  with social signal processing, by modeling people not at object, but as entities with relationship, social rules, and culturally diverse background. The final goal of the project was deploying a robot guide, in collaboration with the KLM airline, in the Schiphol airport of Amsterdam, performing user studies on real passengers to evaluate the validity of the system.

We applied our system to this framework, creating a human-aware robot guide which is able to lead a group of people to a destination. More particularly, the originality of our approach is that the robot is able to show both adaptive and a proactive behaviors. The robot will try, while guiding, to select a speed that pleases its users, when adapting, or to propose a new speed, using environmental and task related stimulus. Finally, our system will proactively try to engage members of the group if it detects they need assistance. 

\subsection{Building a Robot Guide}
In order to adapt our system to the robot guide scenario we had to enhance several modules, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:case_study-spencer-architecture}: 
\begin{itemize}
\item The user is able to interact with the robot by using a tactile interface on its front. We updated our human interface to reflect the commands that the user is able to use.
\item in this scenario we are not really interested in the intention recognition skills that we developed in Chapter \ref{chapter:situation_assessment}. In an airport there are no complex sequence of actions that humans need to perform and we will evaluate users' intentions by their trajectories and the surrounding environment. We develope an Environment-Based Intention Situation Assessment module to enhance our Situation Assessment Layer, presented in Subsection \ref{subsec:case_study-spencer-intention}. This module is able to 
\item Similarly, task planning and plan management is quite simple in this scenario. The robot will mostly vary its paths in the environment, using similar plans. We developed an A*-based task planner, which is able to find a path in a semantic map, to guide users to their destination, presented in Subsection \ref{subsec:case_study-spencer-planner}.
\item The main work, in this application, has been creating a Collaborative Planner to guide users in a human-aware way. Using this planner, our robot is able to adapt itself to users actions, or to proactively propose new behaviors. This planner is presented in Subsection \ref{subsec:case_study-spencer-guiding_users}.
\end{itemize}

	\label{fig:case_study-spencer-architecture}
\end{figure}

The system has been tested with different configurations, in laboratory experiments and in the Schipol airport, as shown in Subsection \ref{subsec:case_study-spencer-lab_exp} and \ref{subsec:case_study-spencer-airport}.

Parts of this work were presented in \ref{fiore2015adaptive}.

\subsection{Environment-Based Situation Assessment}
\label{subsec:case_study-spencer-intention}
There are many situations where, to properly reason on humans, we should link their movements and actions to the current environment. Imagine for example the case where we see a person oriented toward a screen. If an airport, we could infer from this observation that the person is looking at the screen, and perhaps in need of information. 

We introduced, in the Situation Assessment Layer, the ability able to create activity areas in the environment and link them to different kind of computations. An activity area is a polygonal or circular area, which can be fixed or linked and updated with an entity's (object, human or robot) position. We studied and experimented different two activity areas:

\begin{itemize}
\item Information Screen Area. This area, shown in Figure \ref{fig:case_study-spencer-screen_area} is linked to information screens present in the environment. Using this information, the robot can recognize that humans are looking at the screen, and  start a proactive behavior, like approaching to offering help or information.
\item Touristic Point Area, linked to interesting sights and attractions in the environment. We can imagine, for example, to link these areas to painting, statues, or even rooms in a museum. Knowing that a human is in a touristic point area, and looking at an attraction, the robot could approach the human and tell him some interesting information about it.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[ht!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.45]{img/case_study/spencer/environment_intention.pdf}
	\caption{This figure shows how the Information Screen Area used for environment-based intention recognition. The yellow polygon represents an area linked to the screen in the figure. Red polygons represent groups of person in the area. The person in group a is in the screen area, but the robot will infern that he is not looking at the screen, since he is oriented in another direction. The persons in group b are in the screen area and oriented toward the screen, so they are looking at it. The persons in group c are not looking at the screen since they are either oriented in another direction or outside its area.}
	\label{fig:case_study-spencer-architecture}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Task and Motion Planning Problems}
\label{subsec:case_study-spencer-planning}
To guide people in environments like museum or airport, the robot will need to navigate very large areas, which are often too big to perform efficiently motion planning. A solution to this problem is reducing the size of the area where the motion planner will compute its paths, and splitting the navigation problem in a list of sub goals. The problem, with this approach,  is choosing the correct list of sub-goals to reach the final position.  To deal with this issue we implemented an A* based task planner, which will choose a high-level path to be followed by the robot from a semantic map. This map is a hand-crafted graph. composed by different nodes, representing parts of the environemt (corridor, elevator entrance, gates areas, etc.). Each node will be linked to a point in the real world. This task planner will, so, produce a list of coordinates usable by the motion planning layer. 

\begin{figure}[ht!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.45]{img/case_study/spencer/ShengenTaskPlanner.png}
	\caption{This figure shows an example of plan computed in the spencer scenario. The circles represent nodes in the semantic map. The purle node is the starting node of the plan. The red node is the goal. The green node represent intermediate nodes in the plan.}
	\label{fig:case_study-spencer-semantic_plan}
\end{figure}


A first way to manage this kind of plan is simply travelling to each calculated point, sending a goal to the motion planner for the next point every time the robot reach a node. The problem with this approach is that the path followed by the robot might be very inefficient, as shown in the figure %put figure.

Our solution was using a rolling window approach, where the motion planner will plan on a grid map centered on the robot, which will move with it. In this way, the robot will send the next goal in the calculated plan as soon as it is present in the rolling window. It is very important, with this approach to carefully select the nodes in the semantic maps so that the rolling window will contain at least two semantic nodes. If not, the motion planner would have to plan a path to a goal outside its grid map, which would generate an error.

\subsection{Collaborative Planner to Guide a Group}
We developed a new collaborative planner to guide users to a destination. The planner is organized as hierarchic MOMDP, and is composed by several models:
\begin{itemize}
\item Guide Group Model. The main MOMDP of the hierarchy, responsible of choosing the main action performed by the robot.
\item Speed Adaptation Model. This model chooses if the robot should accelerate, decelerate, or keep the current speed.
\item Suspend Model. This module chooses which actions to execute when the group of followers has stopped following.
\end{itemize}


\begin{figure}[ht!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.45]{img/case_study/spencer/guide_planner.pdf}
	\caption{This figure shows the hierarchical MOMDP collaborative planner use to guide a Group. The arrows show the macro-actions of the root of the hierarchy, leading to sub MOMDPs.}
	\label{fig:case_study-spencer-team}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Representing a group}
Our system has been built with the assumption that the robot would navigate in a crowded environment, where its followers could be often occluded. In addition, after speaking with our partners, we understood that the perception components would not be able to maintain a stable identifier for members of the groups, meaning that the robot would not be able to realiably understand if a group of users is following it. We tried to maintain a good balance between accuracy, trying to guide effective users and not people whose which are going in the same direction as the robot, and robustness, copying with unreliable perception.

We built our collaborative planner following these ideas:
\begin{itemize}
\item The robot will record a list $g$ composed by the identifiers of the group at the start of the scenario. During this scenario, it will maintain a list $f$, composed by users that are still tracked whose identifier is in $g$, and another list $o$, composed by all the tracked people whose distance from the robot is less than a costant $d$. 
\item As long as $f$ is not empty, the robot it will choose a \textit{best} follower $b$ from this list, and try tp guide him, using the collaborative planner. The \textit{best} follower is chosen by considering the user whose behavior is the most consistent with the robots, by taking into account the speed, the distance and the orientation of the user.
\item If $f$ is empty, but $o$ is not, the robot will choose a \testit{best} follower $b$ from $o$, and try to guide him, using the collaborative planners.
\item If  both $f$ and $o$ are empty, the robot will abandon the task.
\end{itemize}

Our idea is considering that the robot's followers will \textit{act as a group}, staying together as much as they can. The robot will try to guide members of the group, but if it has lost tracking to all of them, and there is still somebody behind it which is acting in a consistent way with the guiding task, it will think that its users are still following it, but their identifiers have changed in the perception layer.


\subsubsection{Guiding the Group}
The main problem of the robot is choosing if it should still guide the group, suspend temporarily the task, or abandon it. The Guide Planner is the main MOMDP of our architecture and will make this decision, based on three main variables: 
\begin{itemize}
\item The status of advancement of the task. This variables, whose values are ${not\_completed, completed}$, is set by the Action Executor module, in the Plan Execution Layer, depending on the current advancement of the task. The variable will be set as $not_completed$ until the robot as reached the final destination in the plan. 
\item The quality of commitment of the group. This variable, whose values are ${not\_engaged, engaged, not\_interested}$, is hidden, estimated from observations produced by the Situation Assessment Layer. The observations used are: the distance of the user from the robot, its variation, the orientation of the user in respect of the the robot, and if the user is currently moving or still. We expect engaged users to have a behavior that is coherent with the task, moving to follow the robot and taking a similar path. Users are considered not engaged when they stop following, perhaps even disappearing from the robot's sight. Finally, we infer that users are not interest in following the robot if they have stopped following for too long.
\item A timer. This variables can assume the values ${not\_expired, expired}$. When a user is detected as $not\_engaged$, the Action Executor starts a timer. When this timer expires, the value of this variable is set accordingly.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Adapting the Robot's Speed}
We believe that to be socially acceptable, the robot should adapt its speed to his follower. By setting its own pace at the start of the scenario the robot  would risk of being too slow, annoying users, or too fast, which would lead the robot to constantly stop to wait for users, producing an awkward behavior.

The robot defines a desired range of distance $r$ from the group. The distance of the  members of the group from $r$ will influence its actions. 1) If there is a member of the group farther than $r$ the robot will \textit{decelerate}. The main goal of a guide robot should still be guiding all of the group, and so the robot will give priority to people that would like a slower speed. 2) If 1) is false, and the majority of the group is closer to the robot than $r$, the robot will $accelerate$. 3) If 1) and 2) are false, the robot will continue at its pace.

% \begin{enumerate}
% \item if there is a member of the group farther than $r$ the robot will \textit{decelerate}. The main goal of a guide robot should still be guiding all of the group, and so the robot will give priority to people that would like a slower speed.
% \item if 1) is false, and the majority of the group is closer to the robot than $r$, the robot will $accelerate$.
% \item if 1) and 2) are false, the robot will continue at its pace.
% \end{enumerate}



%The robot defines a desired range of distance from the group during the task. When the majority of the group is closer than this range, the robot will estimate that the group wants to \textit{accelerate}.
%The main goal of a guide robot should still be guiding all of the group, and so the robot will give priority to people that would like a slower speed, estimated by computing that their distance from the robot is higher than the selected range, which will prompt the robot to \textit{decelerate}. 
In this paper, $r$ was a predefined vector of numbers, but its values could be learnt and adapted to the users during the task, since different people could prefer following the robot at different distances and positions.
The robot should also not constantly change speed, in order to give time to users to adapt to its new chosen speed, and so we defined a temporal threshold in which we don't allow the robot to repeat an \textit{accelerate} or \textit{decelerate} action.

In this scenario we also studied the idea that the robot can try to influence the speed of the group. We studied two situations in which this idea can be useful. A) There is a time limit to reach the destination. In this case the robot must balance the desire to satisfy the group with the task urgency. Different situations will require different policies. For example, in an airport scenario, the robot could prioritize arriving on time, warning users if their speed would render the goal not achievable, while in other situations the robot could try to arrive in time but still avoid to adopt speeds that are uncomfortable for the group. B) The rules of the current environment limit the robot's speed. In this case the robot will avoid accelerating over a set speed even if it detects that its current velocity is considered too slow for the group. For example, the robot could be navigating in a construction zone.
% \begin{itemize}
%    	\item There is a time limit to reach the destination. In this case the robot must balance the desire to satisfy the group with the task urgency. Different situations will require different policies. For example, in an airport scenario, the robot could prioritize arriving on time, warning users if their speed would render the goal not achievable, while in other situations the robot could try to arrive in time but still avoid to adopt speeds that are uncomfortable for the group.
%    	\item The rules of the current environment limit the robot's speed. In this case the robot will avoid accelerating over a set speed even if it detects that its current velocity is considered too slow for the group. For example, the robot could be navigating in a construction zone.
%     \end{itemize}

This reasoning is done in the Speed Adaptation MOMDP module, which will be interpreted when the Guide Model chooses to keep guiding the group.

\subsubsection{Suspending the task}
In some situation, the robot needs to suspend the task, because the group has stopped following it. In this case, the robot should estimate if this suspension of the collaborative scenario is temporary or permanent, and in the latter case abandon the task. We estimate this information using the Suspend Model and the activity areas from Situation Assessment. We link activity areas to the maximum time we expect that the group will be involved in the linked activity, and with a set of proactive actions that the robot can choose to execute.

In this paper, we investigated a single possible proactive behavior: giving information. In this case, if we detect that one or more  members
of the group has stopped following because it is looking at a touristic sight, or at an information screen, the robot can try to engage him and offer related information. At the moment, we just propose a simple routine-based framework for this behavior, and plan to further study it in the future. We believe that the solution of this problem could be rich, and that the robot should estimate the reaction of the group during the execution of its proactive behavior, in order to be able to interrupt if the group doesn't want to be helped or to resume the original task if they are satisfied by the robot's actions.

We don't want the robot to be stuck for a long time  waiting for the group. If there is a small amount of time to reach the destination, or the group is engaged in the activity for a longer period of time than the one predicted, or the robot can't estimate the reason why the group stopped following, the Suspend Model can issue a warning action, and eventually abandon the task if the group doesn't start following it again.

%\subsection{Robot's reactiveness}
%When robots interact with humans in complex situations there is the risk that it will be too reactive to stimulus from the environment. To be socially acceptable, the level of reactivity of the robot needs to be controlled. As an example, we want to avoid that the robot continuously accelerates and decelerates, or stops and restarts moving, in order to adapt to the group's behavior. We investigated this problem both at the Situation Assesment level, using temporal reasoning, and the Planning Level, testing different time rates in order to interrogate the Collaborative Planners.




\vspace{-10pt}
\subsection{Laboratory Experiments and Analysis}
We used a motion planning software

We use the architecture proposed by the well-established \verb!move_base! package of \verb!ROS! middle-ware \cite{movebase,ros} for navigation, replacing the global planner, i.e. a cost-grid base path planning module, as suggested in \cite{sisbotTRO2007}. This module adds proxemics based costs in the grid-map around the detected humans that are static in the environment. The local planner, i.e. the module responsible for generating motor commands, is a \textit{ContextCost} based algorithm suggested in \cite{kruse12crossing}. This module continuously calculates the \textit{compatibility} of the robot path by predicting and avoiding future collisions with moving persons and simultaneously keeping the robot as close as possible on the planned global path.

It should be noted that in our guiding experiments, the humans are mostly moving behind the robot and therefore the situation remains compatible for the local planner most of the time. During compatible situations the robot simply follows the way-points on the planned global path. The nominal velocity of the robot is set by the supervision system to achieve the desired behavior of slowing-down or speeding-up, as required by the situation.

We performed a first set of experiments with a single user following a robot on a predefined path, in order to test the behaviors of the robot. After that, we tested the system by having a group of three users follow the robot. In this section, we show the results of our experiments on single user data, since they show in a clearer way the behavior of the system. We plan to perform, and present, user studies in the near future in order to analyze how groups of users react to the robot's behavior. Data from these experiments are shown in Table \ref{table:experiment results} \footnote{Videos from our experiments can be seen at http://homepages.laas.fr/mfiore/
icsr2015.html}. We start by showing speed adaptation tests:
\begin{itemize}
\item adapting slow and fast: in these two tests (Figure \ref{Fig:experiments}) we used our system to guide respectively a user that would like to move at a slow pace, and a user that would like to move at a fast speed.
\item no adaptation: in this experiments the robot won't adapt to the speed of the user, setting its own pace and stopping if it is too far.
\end{itemize}

Looking at the data we can see that our system shows lower values for the variance of speed and distance, which means that after a certain time it's able to find a condition of equilibrium with the human followers. The 'no adaptation' system shows a significantly higher variance for both values, since the robot stopped several times to wait for a user. We will now show some tests regarding the proactive behaviors of the robot:

\begin{itemize}
\item proactive slow and fast: during the task, the robot proactively chooses to change pace, in the first case by slowing down and in the second by accelerating. In our tests the user adapted after some seconds to the robot's pace, but this behaviors should be studied in-depth in user studies.
\item suspend with screen and with no reason: in these tests we asked a user to stop during the task. In the first case the user stopped near an information screen. After detecting this event, the robot approached the user to offer information, which lead to the resumption of the task. In the second case the user stopped at a different point of the path. The robot wasn't able to detect the reason for the suspension of the task and so simply   issued a warning to the user and abandoned the task after some seconds.
\end{itemize}
